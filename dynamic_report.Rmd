## What's going on with this data?

Over 22 walks with Izzy, I have recorded observation about the dogs she met.
I tracked how many dogs she met, what *size and colour they were, and how long the walk* was.

Izzy and I went on **`r nrow(latest_data)`** walks together.  
On average, Izzy met **`r round(mean_dogs, 1)`** dogs per walk.  
The most she ever met on a single walk was **`r max_dog`** dogs!

```{r}
### walk duration
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = walk_duration)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#DA70D6") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Walk Durations", x = "Walk Duration", y = NULL)

### Dog Sizes Izzy Encountered
expanded_data <- latest_data %>%
  separate_rows(dog_size, sep = ", ")
ggplot(expanded_data, aes(x = dog_size)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Dog size Izzy Encountered", x = "Dog size", y = "Count")

### Dog colours Izzy Encountered
expanded_data <- latest_data %>%
  separate_rows(dog_colour, sep = ", ")
ggplot(expanded_data, aes(x = dog_colour)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#D8BFD8") + 
  labs(title = "Dog colours Izzy Encountered", x = "Dog Colour", y = "Count")

#number of dogs met per walk (distribution)
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = num_dogs)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#FFB6C1") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Dogs Met Per Walk", x = "Number of Dogs", y = "Frequency")

```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
